# oop-game-v2

To test: 
- Download files and open index.html in your browser.

I have implemented the exceeds expectations requirements including the keyboard functionality, 
as well as some personal customizations: 
- More robust key bindings, making sure that any non-alpha key strokes are ignored
- If you are at the overlay screen (first boot or at a win/loss screen) you can simply hit the Enter key to start a new game
- I have made it so that there is a random background color for each round
- I have added a celebratory animation on the win page.
